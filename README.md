# With-controlled-form

A library of React components created using `create-react-app`.

This library is a HOC that helps you to make `presentational Forms` to `state controlled forms`.

## Installation

Run the following command:

`npm install with-controlled-form`

# Why With-controlled-form ?

This library lets you make your presentational forms as you want, and separate the controlled logic (the state of the form and the events) using the WithControlledForm HOC.
